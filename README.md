# Trisker
Used for creating a Risk AI for the stragety game programming course

# Ideas
* Use multiple MCTS for different Phases (Initial Placing, Reinforcement,...)

# Heuristics
* Reward for occupied continents
* Reward for countries bordering other continents
* Reward for stationing troops near enemies
* Reward for occupying small continents
* Reward for territories occupied per continent

# Current Problems
* We have a problem with our tree. The placement is wrong. We try to build a analysier website.
